### Why did I build this project?
* The purpose of this project was to create a SQL  database to store information about a companys departments, roles and employees. The Employee Management Syste alows users to update, add and view information in any of the tables (Department Table, Role Table, Employee Table).  
### What problems does this project overcome?
* The toughest obsticle to overcome was writing the SQL queries then get the information from those queries and display is t as a table in the terminal using console.table. The other tough part was taking the user input using Inquierer.js and adding it to the SQL database.
### What new skills did I learn?
* Learning to implement inquirer.js with mySQL to update the database and display data.
